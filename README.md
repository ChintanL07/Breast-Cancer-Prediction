# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Prediction project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on various medical attributes. This project is developed using Python and leverages various libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and more. The notebook is designed to process medical data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

## Features

1. **Data Collection**
    - Utilizes a dataset containing medical attributes and breast cancer diagnosis results.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Cleans and prepares the data for training.
3. **Model Training**
    - Trains a machine learning model to predict breast cancer.
4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction**
    - Predicts the likelihood of breast cancer based on the input data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Platform:** Google Colab

## Code Structure

- `Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the implementation of the breast cancer prediction model.

## Usage

1. Run the notebook in Google Colab.
2. The notebook will collect and preprocess medical data.
3. It will then train a machine learning model to predict breast cancer.
4. Finally, it will evaluate the model and make predictions.
